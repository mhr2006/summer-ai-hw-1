From the first clas I learned how there was research on AI since a very long time.
I also was glad to see that we will be gaining experience on how to work on Python as I always wanted to but never understood it.
The computer set up was a bit confusing but I am sure with practice I'll be able to use it without any problem.
Plus I also learned about the different people who contributed in the research and brought AI to where it is at the moment.
